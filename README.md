### :question: Why:
Water is a finite resource and neccessary for all of life so it is important that we take action to conserve it. On average, a person can waste up to 30 gallons of water unknowningly. Through conservation education and awareness, we are able to make informed decisions about water conservation and its effects on the environment. We hope this will lower water usage in the U.S. households. Our website will include a section for ways to conserve water in the kitchen and the shower. We will also include a water usage calculator and tips on appliances to use to lower water usage.
