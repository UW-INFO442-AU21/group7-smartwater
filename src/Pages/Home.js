            <h1>Freshwater is being depleted.</h1>
            <p>There is only a limited amount of freshwater in the world and it is currently getting depleted each day. Because many households in the United States have quick access to water, they often overlook the problem of water waste from their everyday habits, such as brushing teeth with the faucet on or leaving the water on while washing dishes. While it may seem like an
insignificant act, five gallons of water is lost each time an individual leaves their faucet running
when brushing their teeth. All these little actions will amount to an accumulation of water waste
over time and it is barely noticeable by the masses due to the fact that water is cheap and easily
accessible in the US.</p>
